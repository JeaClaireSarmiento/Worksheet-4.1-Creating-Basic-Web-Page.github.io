  <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hi! I am Jea Claire Sarmiento from Cawit, Boac, Marinduque, 19 years old. I was born on July 30, 2004 at Lucena City, and  I am an only child. I am a second year college student, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Marinduque State College. In my free time, I enjoy watching thai series like bl series or drama. I also love visiting my grandma and grandpa on my mom's side every time I have time. Since pandemic started I discovered that I am an introverted person. Before I like playing violin and keyboard but since pandemic happened I stop learning some music instruments. This is just a simple introduction, thank you.</p>

<h4>Background on Information Technology</h4>
<p>My background in I.T is not so easy, it is so hard. I cried sometimes cause I feel like I can't. I have so many struggles during this time. I experience on how to disassemble and assemble, it was so fan. By studying IT, you'll experience a lot of skills that you haven't seen  before. You'll also learn how to design and develop software applications, and secure computer systems. Having a background in Information Technology as a college student opens up a wide range of career paths. You can pursue roles such as software developer, data analyst, network engineer, cybersecurity specialist, IT consultant, or project manager.

<p>Information Technology is a vast and ever-evolving field, so it is normal to have moments of uncertainty. Embrace the learning process, seek out resources, and leverage technology to enhance your understanding and skills. I understand that some college student like me, may have reached a point where we are  no longer want to pursue a course in information technology. It's important to make informed decisions about your education and career path. I'll one point to consider when reevaluating your interest in information technology: If you decide to switch to a different field, you may need to acquire additional education or training. Research programs, certifications, or courses that can help you gain the necessary skills and knowledge for your chosen field. Many institutions offer flexible options, including online courses, to accommodate career changers.</p>
